# Fall Detection System

A machine learning project that detects human falls from video streams or image sequences using pre-trained deep learning models.  
Optimized for CPU-only environments for efficient and real-time deployment.

## 📌 Features
- Uses pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, Tiny YOLO, PoseNet)
- Detects human falls from video inputs
- Outputs processed video with detection results
- Lightweight and optimized for CPU-only systems
- Implemented in Google Colab

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on model), Matplotlib
- **Frameworks/Models:** MobileNet / Tiny YOLO / PoseNet
- **Tools:** Google Colab
